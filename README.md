# Rootella
A Nexus custom romming, rooting, unlocking etc tool for Windows, Mac and Linux built in Python. Requires ADB service.
# Alert
This tool was never completed, it's codebase is terrible. I wouldn't trust this with your device unless you know how to get out of a softbrick. If I can be bothered, I might continue this project. But I'm sure you know, you should always understand how the command line works without just using scripts like this.
